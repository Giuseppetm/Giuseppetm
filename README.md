## ↘️ About me
### Hello there 👋
I am a front-end software engineer with over 3 years of professional experience, currently working as a consultant at [Deloitte Digital](https://www.deloittedigital.com/it/en.html) designing and implementing front‑end architectures for leading luxury fashion brands, including [Dolce & Gabbana](https://www.dolcegabbana.com/it-it/) and [Brunello Cucinelli](https://shop.brunellocucinelli.com/it-it/).

I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science from the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/it), where I was actively engaged as an elected student representative in the Computer Science department, providing support to peers and collaborating with faculty to improve academic programs. During my studies, I contributed to the European Horizon 2020 project [Smart Bear](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/857172/it), dedicating my thesis to the development of a remote monitoring system for managing FHIR data relating to patients.

#### Outside of work, I dedicate time to building community‑driven projects.

- I co-founded in 2020 the ([Network StudentiUniMi](https://studentiunimi.it/)), a groundbreaking university platform officially recognized by the University of Milan: this project serves over 25,000 students, offering organized, moderated chats, custom bots, and valuable resources to foster connectivity and collaboration within the academic community.

- I created [Syndrome Main Computer](https://github.com/Giuseppetm/syndrome-main-computer), a faithful recreation of Syndrome’s iconic mainframe from "The Incredibles", which has garnered millions of views worldwide.
