### ↘️ About me
I'm a front-end developer currently working at [People Lab SRL](https://www.peoplelab.it/) as consultant for [Protocube Reply](https://protocube.it/).

I studied computer science at the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/it), where I later worked on a H2020 European project called [Smart Bear](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/857172/it). 

I have worked in multiple contexts such as clinical, industrial, and e-commerce-related fields.

My passion for development led me to create the most advanced university website in Italy ([studentiunimi.it](https://studentiunimi.it/)). I contribute daily to make communication between students at the University of Milan easier and to make groups, services, and many other resources available. 

All the personal projects I have created so far are open-source.
