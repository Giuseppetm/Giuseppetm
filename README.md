### ↘️ About me
I am a front-end software engineer with over 3 years of professional experience, currently working as a consultant at [Deloitte Digital](https://www.deloittedigital.com/it/en.html). My career has allowed me to explore and excel in diverse domains, including clinical, industrial, and e-commerce projects, collaborating with both consulting firms and product-focused companies. I specialize in frameworks such as React and Vue, with a keen interest in server-side rendering and performance optimization.

I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science from the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/it), where I was actively engaged as an elected student representative in the Computer Science department, providing support to peers and collaborating with faculty to improve academic programs. During my studies, I contributed to the European Horizon 2020 project [Smart Bear](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/857172/it), dedicating my thesis to the development of a remote monitoring system for managing FHIR data relating to patients.

My passion for development has driven me to co-found the ([Network StudentiUniMi](https://studentiunimi.it/)), a groundbreaking university platform officially recognized by the University of Milan. This project serves over 25,000 students, offering organized, moderated chats, custom bots, and valuable resources to foster connectivity and collaboration within the academic community.
